When learning ast, it is difficult for me to understand the recursive calls between several operator methods, the connection between methods, and the structure of ast nodes. After that, I consulted a lot of information, as well as teaching videos on udemy, and understood that the method in the parse process is based on low priority -> high recursion, the specific composition of ast nodes, how to build a tree structure, and how to evaluate it
